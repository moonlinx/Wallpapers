## Why?

- I wanted a repository for my wallpapers
- I just reset my macbook and I lost all of my wallpapers ![sad](https://media.tenor.com/5lbcs68aI2MAAAAC/anime-sad.gif)
- I will most likely name each image and make folders over time. Just not any
  time soon as that is a bit annoying.
- Anyone is welcome to use these wallpapers
